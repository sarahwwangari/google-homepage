Hey you!

So glad to be here. This my first project using HTML and CSS. I'm learning to code with The Odin Project and I hope to build more projects in the coming months! There, I've said it now I actually have to do it (hehehe).

What I've learnt working on recreating the Google Homepage?

a) Flexbox! Never though this would happen. I would like to thank Flexbox Froggy- whenever I couldn't figure out how to position a div or center an element, I would play this game and things just started to click.

b)Material Icons. This one was a whole new one for me. The guys at StackoverFlow have it down for sure.

c)I'm starting to look at web elements as squares regardless of their shapes. Sure, the search form is a flattened-oval, but it's in a square. Hope that makes sense.

What I need to work on understanding?

a) I'm a having a tough time deciding what units to use for padding, margin, bottom, width... things like that. Each article I read just takes me through a rabbit hole of px, %, em, and rems. 

b) How do you make sure all your elements are on one page? Like, the one I have is scrollable and I can't seem to make everything stay on one page. Something to read about.

c)Git, GitHub, Git, GitHub... If you're reading this, I guess I've figured at least one of them out.

That's it from me folks!
